# HS-CS-Final_Project
High School Final Computer Science Project - Game made in Java (with Graphics!)

Final Project for an intruductory Computer Science Class in Java, completed January 2019.

Sole author is myself.

Programmed in Java with the assistance of NetBeans and its GUI creation tool.
Art assets made in GIMP. Original composition made with a synthesizer keyboard and recorded using Logic.

Features a text-based-game-like interface with a "screen" to show environments, textboxes to show in-game text, a feild for the user to imput instructions/interactions to do in the room with an enter key to imput the text into the program, a win condition to find the key to escape, and an easter egg where the user can also find the key by interacting with the mop bucket too much.
